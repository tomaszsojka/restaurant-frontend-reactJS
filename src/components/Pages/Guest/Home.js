            Every day, before dawn, without fail, each store begins to grind up soybeans, roll out the dough for the oven baked bun and light the stoves to begin frying the deep fried crullers.
            Over the years the weary individuals working the grave yard shifts, the foreigners visiting LA, and those getting ready to go to work stop by our restaurants to enjoy hot, freshly ground soy milk,
            made to order dishes such as fried daikon cake and egg crepes or our many styles of rice rolls, filling up their stomachs and their hearts.
            We take pride in the faces of our satisfied customers leaving the restaurant after having taken respite from their busy lives to truly enjoy a traditional meal reminding them of our cultural heritage.
